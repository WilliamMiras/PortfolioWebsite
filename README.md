Coding a Personal Portfolio Website to showcase my skills, projects, and myself. 
Hopefully, the website is very informative about who I am and all the skills that I can bring to the table.
I had a lot of fun learning HTML and CSS along the way and fixing all the bugs that arose.
I also learned to get more familiar with VS Code and loved the Live Preview feature they had so I could see in live time what I was doing and how my website looked.
